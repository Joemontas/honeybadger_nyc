                                        In my 20’s, I got a major in advertising, and spent several years working in graphic design, 
                                        for sign companies, and later on as associate producer for advertising agencies.
                                        However I’ve always had pretty god technical skills. I am the typical computer guy who 
                                        family and friends always call when they have issues with their computers and other 
                                        electronic devices.<br>
                                        <br>
                                                
                                        Awhile ago, I realized that maybe coding would be suitable for me, given the fact that 
                                        I was looking to change careers, so I decided to get some formal studies in that field 
                                        and I love it!. It is challenging, requires a lot of logical thinking and demands to 
                                        be up to date with new tendencies and technologies.<br>

                                        When I am not working, I spend time with my daughter, who is super busy. Love to play 
                                        tennis, and video games. I am also a baseball fan. Let’s go Yankees!<br>

                                        Actually I am the Production Manager for a Sign company in Manhattan. However I am 
                                        willing to move to the coding field. I’d love to meet new people, so feel free to 
                                        say hi or share an story.<br>
